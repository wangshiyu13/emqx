Added a bootstrap file to batch loading banned data when initializing a single node or cluster, in other words, the import operation is performed only if there is no data in the database.


This file is a CSV file with `,` as its delimiter.

The first line of this file must be a header line. All valid headers are listed here:
- as :: required
- who :: required
- by  :: optional
- reason :: optional
- at :: optional
- until :: optional

See the documentation for details on each field.

Each row in the rest of this file must contain the same number of columns as the header line,
and column can be omitted then its value will be `undefined`.
