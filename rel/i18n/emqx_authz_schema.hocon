An array of authorization (ACL) data providers.
It is designed as an array, not a hash-map, so the sources can be
ordered to form a chain of access controls.<br/>

When authorizing a 'publish' or 'subscribe' action, the configured
sources are checked in order. When checking an ACL source,
in case the client (identified by username or client ID) is not found,
it moves on to the next source. And it stops immediately
once an 'allow' or 'deny' decision is returned.<br/>

If the client is not found in any of the sources,
the default action configured in 'authorization.no_match' is applied.<br/>

NOTE:
The source elements are identified by their 'type'.
It is NOT allowed to configure two or more sources of the same type."""
